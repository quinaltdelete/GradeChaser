What is Gradechaser?
Basic overview
Gradechaser is a true consensus grading system. That means that anyone who has climbed a boulder problem can have a say in ranking how hard it is. 
At the simplest level, think of it as voting for the grade you think a boulder problem should be given. 

How to use it
Instead of giving a boulder problem a v-grade, you compare it to other problems you’ve sent. You can add as many comparisons as you want. 
Search for a specific climb, then name any other problems you’ve done that felt easier, and any that felt harder. And I mean any - 
it’s still useful for the system to know that the super-easy warm up is in fact easier than the latest v-17 mega proj. 
Just make sure to stick to comparing problems you’ve actually sent - the whole point of the system is to leverage the relative feeling of difficulty, 
not what you assume is the harder or easier climb.

Why is it useful?
Consensus grading is good
One of the problems with traditional grading is that any given number grade is totally subjective. After climbing for a while, most climbers start to 
get a sense of what a certain grade feels like, more or less, but everyone has had the experience of getting on a certain grade and feeling like it’s 
way harder than what book calls it. Or vice-versa: you send a climb in a couple goes, even when you’re used to spending multiple sessions in order to 
put down a climb at that grade. 

Despite this, most climbers tend to just accept the grade that the guidebook gives it. No shade to guidebooks (guidebook authors are the under-valued 
heroes of climbing), but it creates a default assumption that the guidebook is the last word on grading. Most often, guidebook authors either take the 
grade from the first ascensionist, or simply just ask around until they find someone local who “knows” the grade. Either way, it means that a single 
person’s opinion gets set in stone. 

Grades get way more discussion at the cutting-edge of bouldering. The grade a first ascensionist originally proposed might get challenged, and if enough 
hard climbers say something different, it might go from a V16 to a V15. But for the rest of us, grades rarely get much thought. Instead of just accepting 
a single opinion, Gradechaser offers a way for everyone to have a say in how hard we call a problem.
